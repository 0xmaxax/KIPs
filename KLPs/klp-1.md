## Summary:

Kyber Network is exploring the listing of the following 5 ERC-20 tokens and the corresponding reserves: [Grid](https://gridplus.io/), [Mantra DAO](https://mantradao.com/), [RedFox](https://www.redfoxlabs.io/), [StrongBlock](https://strongblock.com/), [TokenAsset](https://tokenasset.com/).

Tokens: [Grid](https://gridplus.io/), [Mantra DAO](https://mantradao.com/), [RedFox](https://www.redfoxlabs.io/), [StrongBlock](https://strongblock.com/), [TokenAsset](https://tokenasset.com/)\
Reserves: [Grid](https://gridplus.io/), [Mantra DAO](https://mantradao.com/), [RedFox](https://www.redfoxlabs.io/), [StrongBlock](https://strongblock.com/), [TokenAsset](https://tokenasset.com/)

As a part of Kyber Network’s approach of progressive decentralization and our long-term plan to transfer more control to the KyberDAO, token listing decisions - ‘Approve’ or ‘Reject’ - will be undertaken by the KyberDAO members. This is explained in our [KLP framework](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-5.md/).

Please visit kyber.org, connect your wallet, and stake KNC to participate in the governance and decision-making process for KLP-1.


## Motivation:

To gain approval to support the specified assets: [Grid](https://gridplus.io/), [Mantra DAO](https://mantradao.com/), [RedFox](https://www.redfoxlabs.io/), [StrongBlock](https://strongblock.com/), [TokenAsset](https://tokenasset.com/).

KLP is part of Kyber’s commitment towards transparency and community engagement while on the path of progressive decentralization.

## Methodology:

Any new token or reserve listing requires approval from KyberDAO members and liquidity support from the token team/liquidity provider. 

Tokens have to be ERC-20 tokens based on Ethereum and each KLP campaign on Kyber.org will last 4 days. A campaign can start anytime as long as the start time is at least 4 days before the end of the Epoch.

There is **no guarantee that approved tokens or reserves will be listed** even after they are approved by the KyberDAO, since liquidity still needs to be sourced for that token. A token needs at least 1 reserve to be set up to support it. There could also be unforeseen circumstances that result in a listing delay.

To help KyberDAO members in the decision-making process, here is a quick summary of each token:
