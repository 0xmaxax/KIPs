## Summary:

Kyber Network is exploring the listing of the following 4 ERC-20 tokens and the corresponding reserves: [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/), [Energi](https://www.energi.world/), [Everest](https://everest.org/), [Morpheus Labs](https://morpheuslabs.io/).

Tokens: [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/), [Energi](https://www.energi.world/), [Everest](https://everest.org/), [Morpheus Labs](https://morpheuslabs.io/)
Reserves: [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/), [Energi](https://www.energi.world/), [Everest](https://everest.org/), [Morpheus Labs](https://morpheuslabs.io/)

As a part of Kyber Network's approach of progressive decentralization and our long-term plan to transfer more control to the KyberDAO, token listing decisions — `Approve` or `Reject` — will be undertaken by the KyberDAO members. This is explained in our KLP framework.

Please visit kyber.org, connect your wallet, and stake KNC to participate in the governance and decision-making process for KLP-2.

## Motivation:

To gain approval to support the specified assets: [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/), [Energi](https://www.energi.world/), [Everest](https://everest.org/), [Morpheus Labs](https://morpheuslabs.io/).

KLP is part of Kyber's commitment towards transparency and community engagement while on the path of progressive decentralization.

## Methodology:

Any new token or reserve listing requires approval from KyberDAO members and liquidity support from the token team/liquidity provider. 

Tokens have to be ERC-20 tokens based on Ethereum and each KLP campaign on Kyber.org will last 4 days. A campaign can start anytime as long as the start time is at least 4 days before the end of the Epoch.

There is **no guarantee that approved tokens or reserves will be listed** even after they are approved by the KyberDAO, since liquidity still needs to be sourced for that token. A token needs at least 1 reserve to be set up to support it. There could also be unforeseen circumstances that result in a listing delay.

To help KyberDAO members in the decision-making process, here is a quick summary of each token: 

### 1inch (Domain - DAO)
With the new 1INCH token, 1inch Network will now be governed by a DAO.The independent board of the 1inch Foundation has released 1INCH, a governance and utility token. The 1inch Foundation intends to support the adoption of the 1INCH token via the permissionless and decentralized 1inch Network.The 1INCH token will be used to govern all 1inch Network protocols, taking governance in the DeFi space to a new level.
