## Summary

There are approximately `24,912,378 KNC tokens` remaining in the Kyber ecosystem fund after allocating for liquidity mining campaigns on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC and Avalanche. 

There are many projects on these chains that are proposing to be part of the ‘Rainmaker’ liquidity mining program. 

KIP-14 enables the DAO operator to allocate an additional 5,000,000 KNC (from the remaining KNC in the ecosystem fund) to be utilised in the upcoming ‘Rainmaker’ joint liquidity mining campaigns based on this [framework](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-8.md).
